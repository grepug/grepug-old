I have to admit that, I've been in really bad condition for months. And I know it is the time to end this.

I love programming, and I know how far from a professional programmer for me. I learn this completely by myself. It is the personal interest that drive me to learn, to code. But I always know that I possibly won't go further in this field, due to the reality that I don't learn the basic of computer science and advanced mathematics. I basicly know nothing of them. I feel a sense of crisis.

### Do I really need to be a Professional Programmer

Well, my dream has never changed that I want to sart my own business. I am going to build my team, and act as a team member to finish our innovative inventions and put a dent in the universe.

It is the age of information technology. If you want to take a piece of the age, you are going to know about it. You want to know technology, you want to know how can use it to influence people in the way to live, to work, to entertain. And somehow make profits from it.

For me, as a founder of a start-up, do I have to be a professional programmer and decision maker? I am not sure about this.

### I Know the Conclusion

Just be as perfect as I can. A perfect founder won't miss an amazing company, as well as their products. So, decision must be make that I have to end this bad condition right now, so I can be more concentrated on the goal I pursuit.

#### Well, you can't write C, C++, Java, Object-C, Python, and so forth, but You can write JavaScript, so Just Stick It On
